Syntax Validation Program determines whether text entered in the window is consistent with  certain specifications.
HTML and CSS form the skeleton of the code while functionality and styling for the green or red button that reflects next to validity result are in JavaScript.
Regex sets specifications for the text to be entered in the input window.
 JavaScript if/else conditional checks whether the text entered is consistent with the syntax specified. If the syntax is correct a message pops up approving it with a green circle, should it be incorrect the messagealerts the user of the fact and displays a red circle.

 Issues:
 Regex is not part of the provided course material and I needed to google the solution.
